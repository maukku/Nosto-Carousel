# Nosto-Carousel

This project utilizes the  Nosto's GraphQL API to display a list of products from your online store in a modern, responsive website. The most popular product, as determined by sales data from  Nosto, is prominently displayed at the top in a bigger size. The rest of the products are displayed below, in a grid layout that adapts to the size of the user's screen.

This project is written in modern JavaScript (ES6) , SCSS and follows best practices for web development, including responsive design, the use of  Nosto's official colors and typography.


In addition to displaying the product images, names, and prices it also includes interactive features to enhance the user experience. When you hover your mouse over a product image, an alternate  image may will be displayed. This can be useful for displaying multiple views of the product or for highlighting certain features.

Clicking on a product image will take you to the product's page on the Nosto site, where you can learn more about the product and make a purchase.
